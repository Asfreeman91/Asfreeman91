## Hi, my name's Alex 👋

I'm a full stack developer. Recently, I completed back-end and front-end developer courses at Promineo Tech and I'm certified in both. Currently, I'm looking for an intership or job opportunity. 

- 🐢 I’m currently working on a turtles REST API. I love turtles and I have two Red-footed tortoises. I plan on adding more to this database but it currently includes different turtle species, as well as their characteristics and locations where they can be found. 
- 🖥 I’m currently working on a hiking website that allows users to save their favorite hikes. 
- 🎮 Fun fact: I have a bachelor's degree in medical laboratory science. I also enjoy backpacking and playing video games.
